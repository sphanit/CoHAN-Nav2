ROS2 Version


CoHAN-Nav2 is an enhanced version of the Cooperative Human-Aware Navigation framework, building on the foundations of the original [CoHAN](https://github.com/sphanit/cohan_planner_multi) system [Singamaneni et al., IROS 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636613). This new iteration significantly improves the stability and robustness of the navigation pipeline in dynamic human environments. A key advancement in CoHAN-Nav2 is the integration of behavior trees for context-aware mode switching, enabling more structured and scalable decision-making during navigation.

The system maintains tight integration with the ROS navigation stack and leverages the [Human-Aware Timed Elastic Band (HATEB)](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-02922029/file/Ro_Man_2020.pdf) planner for trajectory generation, while the newly introduced behavior-based layer allows the robot to seamlessly adapt between social contexts and allows easier integration of new behaviors.

In addition to behavior-based mode switching, CoHAN-Nav2 incorporates reasoning about invisible humans in the environment, as introduced in [Singamaneni et al., IROS 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9982186). By fusing observed human motion with static map information, the system infers the presence of humans who may be occluded or temporarily out of sensor range. This allows the planner to proactively account for hidden human activity—enhancing safety and social compliance in complex, cluttered spaces.

# Quick Installation on Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS Humble
## Installation
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sphanit/CoHAN-Nav2.git -b main ~/
  cd ~/CoHAN-Nav2
  ./install-deps.sh ## Install all the dependencies
  ./compile.sh ## Compiles the packages
  ```
## Usage
You can find the sample launch and config files in cohan2.0_navigation. Here is how to launch and test on a simulated PR2.
  ```
  cd ~/CoHAN-Nav2
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 launch cohan_sim_navigation cohan_sim_pr2_launch.py
  ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard cmd_vel:=/human1/cmd_vel
  ```
Now you can give a goal to the robot and move the human around with teleop to test the system.
